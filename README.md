# Vulcan
Vulcan gives you a fireworks show right in your browser! It is largely physically accurate.

**This project is still in the phase of preliminary design. It is not functional.**

## Installation
Simply include the `vulcan.js` script in your document using your preferred method.

## Quick Start Guide
  1. Create a `<canvas>` element where you would like your fireworks show,

   ```html
   <canvas id="canvas" width="300" height="300"></canvas>
   ```
  2. initialize the vulcan script,

   ```js
   let fireworks = new Vulcan("canvas");
   ```
  ...and you're ready to go!
